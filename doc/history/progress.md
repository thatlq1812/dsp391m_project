## 2025-10-05 - Initial prototype scaffold and smoke tests
- Summary:
- Created a minimal prototype scaffold for the real-time traffic data platform.
- Implemented a FastAPI server (`app/`) with endpoints for node forecasts and events.
- Added mock collectors and a background scheduler to produce periodic snapshots into `data/`.
- Implemented a naive baseline forecast (`models/baseline.py`).
- Ran collectors and a smoke test: started the API and queried `/v1/nodes/node-1/forecast`.
- Files added/changed (high level):
- `requirements.txt` â€” dependencies for prototype
- `README.md` â€” quick start and notes
- `app/main.py`, `app/api.py`, `app/scheduler.py` â€” FastAPI + scheduler
- `collectors/mock_collectors.py`, `run_collectors.py` â€” mock data producers
- `models/baseline.py` â€” naive persistence model
- `data/*` â€” sample node catalog and generated `traffic_snapshot.csv`, `events.json`
- How tested:
- `python run_collectors.py` created `data/traffic_snapshot.csv` and `data/events.json`.
- `uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000` run the API and `curl` returned 200 + JSON.
- Notes / issues:
- To avoid dependency issues with pyarrow/numpy in some conda envs, mock collectors write CSV/JSON using stdlib. For production parquet/feature-store we will pin compatible pyarrow/numpy or use conda-forge builds.
- Next steps (suggested):
1. Integrate Openâ€‘Meteo (weather) and OSM Overpass (static topology) as first real data sources (no API key required).
2. Scaffold Postgres + alembic for metadata/feature-store (use docker-compose) or decide object storage.
3. Implement baseline LSTM training pipeline once stable timeseries snapshots are stored.

- Ran normalize pipeline, producing 157 node snapshots.
- Unit tests pass.
- Notes / issues:
- Google collector is mock due to API key requirement.
- Scheduler uses subprocess for simplicity; could be improved with async.

2. Add features pipeline for model input.
3. Train baseline model on collected data.
4. Integrate with Postgres for storage.
5. Add GCP deployment scripts.
